      "Whether it's high-quality imported products offered on Tmall Global, or overseas travel experiences through travel portal Fliggy, or videos on digital entertainment platform Youku, or on-demand meal delivery and grocery delivery services from Ele.me and Hema, Alibaba is driving a comprehensive consumption upgrade that cannot be matched by any peers.\n",
      "The robust growth of our business speaks to the unique value proposition that we offer to customers through strong execution and commitment to innovation, demonstrating the power and the synergies of the Alibaba digital economy.\n",
      "By leveraging Recommendation Feeds throughout Mobile Taobao, we can help merchants create new demands by targeting the relevant consumer groups, building awareness and interest, activating purchase intent and retaining consumers in different stages of consumption.\n",
      "Revenue grew 90% during the quarter, driven by growth of paying customers and a subscription for higher value-added products.\n",
      "At the core, our data insights on both enterprises and consumers and our leading cloud computing technologies created a unique Alibaba business operating system for this digital era.\n",
      "We believe by leveraging our technology, experience and resources, we can deliver digital transformation for all our clients in the areas of retail, marketing, finance, logistics, manufacturing and other supporting services within the Alibaba business operating system.\n",
      "We delivered another quarter of strong user growth in both MAUs and annual active consumers, facilitated by our effort to target new consumer groups and penetrate into less developed areas in China.\n",
      "We also see enhanced consumer engagement from our existing users that resulted in robust GMV results in which Tmall continues to expand market leadership in B2C e-commerce and Taobao recorded its third consecutive quarter of strong GMV growth.\n",
      "The increase was mainly driven by the robust revenue growth of our China commerce retail business, the consolidation of Ele.me and the Cainiao Network as well as strong revenue growth of Alibaba Cloud.\n",
      "The increase is mainly due to three reasons: number one, our consolidation of Ele.me and Cainiao Network, resulting in higher cost in logistics and fulfillment; number two, the cost of inventory from our New Retail businesses are included due to gross revenue accounting; number three, greater content investments by our digital media and entertainment businesses.\n",
      "While it will take time for us to see financial return for these strategic investments in core commerce, revenue growth of these four business areas has been robust.\n",
      "And then let's take a look at cloud computing revenue growth, 90% year on-year; continued to be very strong, primarily driven by revenue mix towards high value-added products and services and robust growth of paying customers.\n",
      "As Daniel mentioned, we believe the Recommendation Feeds will be further enhanced by the new Taobao interface that include better discovery experience for consumers, enhanced ability to target, engage, and retain consumer by its merchants, increase monetizable properties for the platform.\n",
      "We will continue to grow new users and serve our customers, consumers and merchants with diversified offerings of goods, services and entertainment across our platform.\n",
